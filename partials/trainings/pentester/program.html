              The training course spans over 13 lessons, about three hours each. The students have two classes per week.
              Classes are being recorded and remain available on YouTube, so you can review them if you missed a class.
              Our tutors are the BSG pentesting experts focusing on the corresponding areas.

            <h5 class="training-program__list-title">Practical assignments</h5>
            <p>
              Throughout the course, our tutors assign students the tasks to solve in the online labs. The assignments
              vary from topic to topic and aim at strengthening the studentsâ€™ understanding of the material. Tutors
              guide and support the students in their homework.

            <h5 class="training-program__list-title">Exam and certification</h5>
            <p>
              The course exam is a week-long real-world web application pentest. In the end, students document all
              findings and prepare an industry-grade pentest report. All students get an attendance certificate, but
              only those who accomplished both units of this course can pass the final test and get a certificate of
              achievement.
