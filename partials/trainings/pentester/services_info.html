            The BWAPT program is split into two units: basic and advanced. First, the Basic course teaches application
            security and web pentesting fundamentals. Then, the Advanced course is a series of deep dives into complex
            and modern attacks on web apps. Through both courses, students have practical assignments in the freely
            available online labs. After completing both training units, the students are accepted to the final
            examination and get a chance to obtain the BSG Web Application Penetration Tester certificate (BWAPT).
