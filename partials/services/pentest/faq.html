                A penetration test is a red-teaming exercise that allows organizations to measure their cybersecurity by
                running a controlled attack simulation. Qualified experts conduct the security assessment in a way that
                avoids unnecessary downtime or other business continuity issues. Several professional certification
                programs exist to attest to the skills and experience of qualified pentesters. To get an independent
                opinion, companies usually order penetration tests from external qualified service providers.

                Although they provide similar results, vulnerability assessments are usually highly automated by the use
                of vulnerability scanners. As a result, their reports have many false positives and miss the areas where
                security assessment requires human intelligence and professional judgment. Vulnerability assessment is a
                crucial part of every organization's internal security program, while penetration tests are external to
                the organization, need special skills, and produce independent, higher-quality results.

                Every organization that uses information technology needs cybersecurity. Some companies possess
                intellectual property or store and operate client data. Others rely on modern tech for automation and
                payment processing. Virtually every business uses email and connects to the internet. Malicious hackers
                can abuse every use of modern technology and harm your business. And penetration testing allows you to
                check if you are protected against these threats.

                Pentests can be internal or external depending on where the pentesters start from and what access
                permissions they have in the beginning. For instance, beginning with zero access from the external
                internet means that the pentesting is external. On the contrary, starting with default employee access
                from an office Wi-Fi implies an internal pentest. Starting positions and access levels vary depending on
                the pentest goals.

                Pentests can be black-box, white-box, or grey-box. The box color depends on the amount of information
                that pentesters have in the beginning. For example, zero-knowledge implies that the scope is a "black
                box" to pentesters, and they have to go through all the reconnaissance steps to gain that knowledge. On
                the other hand, the white-box approach means that pentesters have full read access to all scope details,
                such as documentation, source code, or file systems. Finally, the grey-box approach balances these two
                extremes at a point where pentesters start with limited knowledge and permissions.

                The pentest goal is to improve security and not to ruin the operations. However, the pentesting methods
                cannot guarantee absolute safety because one cannot be sure how fragile the client's systems are.

                Ransomware is booming as around 70% of all cyberattacks on the business end up holding their precious
                data for ransom. Unfortunately, when all your data is stolen or encrypted, it is way too late to protect
                it. In fact, the only way to prevent the dire consequences of cyberattacks is to fight tomorrow's
                security challenges – today. Penetration testing reveals existing vulnerabilities that may allow
                cybercriminals to attack your organization. By fixing these vulnerabilities, you make the malicious
                hackers' job hard enough that they decide to skip to another target. It is cheaper to harden your
                systems today than pay the ransom or recover everything from backups tomorrow.

                An average penetration testing project takes about 3-4 weeks to complete; the report with all findings
                and recommendations comes during the following week. The pentest price depends on the scope size, e.g.
                how many systems, networks, and people are there.
